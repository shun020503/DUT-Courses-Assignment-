*Separate Chaining:
Advantages:
- Simple implementation.
- No limit on load factor.
Disadvantages:
- Memory overhead for linked lists.
- Potential cache performance issues.

*Open Addressing:
Advantages:
- Simple (Linear probing).
- Better cache performance.
Disadvantages:
- Clustering issues (Linear probing).
- Complex (Quadratic probing, Double hashing).

*Chaining with BST:
Advantages:
- Efficient searches with a balanced tree.
- Maintains sorted order.
Disadvantages:
- Increased complexity and memory usage.

*Cuckoo Hashing:
Advantages:
- Constant worst-case time for operations.
Disadvantages:
- Complex to implement.
- Limited by the constant factor.

*Robin Hood Hashing:
Advantages:
- Reduces variance in probe lengths.
Disadvantages:
- Increased complexity.
- Theoretical advantages may not always translate to real-world gains.
